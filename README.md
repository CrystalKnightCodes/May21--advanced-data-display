# May 2021 -- Advanced Data Display

Hello everyone! I'm very excited to get started with class and I hope you are too. Over the next 4 weeks we will cover lots of fun topics around displaying data in iOS apps. We will also tackle problems and challenges that software engineers face everyday around the world. This is all to get you to begin to think like an engineer. It will be difficult, but I hope also a lot of fun.

As you can tell by reading this, we will use Github for all assignments, notes, and any other info that needs to be shared with the whole class. As a first step, please star this repository. It will create a bookmark in your account so you can find it easily.
